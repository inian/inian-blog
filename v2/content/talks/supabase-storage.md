title: Building Supabase Storage. DevX, performance, security - choose three
description: Balancing Developer Experience with other concerns like performance and security is not straightforward. For example, you might be able to expose a simpler API at the cost of system performance. This talk goes into how we balance these concerns when we launched Supabase Storage. Supabase Storage is an object storage service that tightly integrates with Postgres and leverages our existing Auth System elegantly. There are a lot of interesting design choices we had to make along the way to build the storage middleware and the client APIs. We explore why we built yet another object storage system and the pitfalls we avoided by evaluating prior work. The architecture we settled on also had the benefit of being extensible to more storage backends in the future. We also put in a lot of thought in making the storage client APIs simple and familiar.
