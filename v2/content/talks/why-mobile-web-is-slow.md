title: Why the Mobile Web Is Slow and What You Can Do about It - Geekcamp
description: Performance of your websites matters a great deal - especially on mobile. In this talk you will learn about what exactly slows down your website on mobile phones. JS, CSS, HTML, images, fonts - all play a very important role in how fast the browser is able to render your webpage. I will discuss how the interplay of these components affects web-page performance as a whole and how concepts like the critical rendering path can help you increase your websiteâ€™s performance manifold. Using these techniques, we conducted an experiment on the top 100 Alexa websites. We were able to show a speed improvement of upto 300% on a standard 3G connection in some of these websites. This talk was recorded at GeekCampSG 2015 on 26 September 2015.
